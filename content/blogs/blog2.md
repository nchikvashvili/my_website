I have competed in and won several domestic and international finance and consulting case competitions.
1. Credit Suisse HOLT Valuation Challenge (*winner*)
2. Finance 360 (*3rd place in individual rating and 1st place in team rating*)
3. Cup Moscow (*2nd place*)
4. FinTech cup (*2nd place*)


This experience has helped me not only improve valuable skills, but also helped me bond with my teammates and make great friendships along the way. One time we spent an entire night solving a complex case on a potential LBO deal in a motel room with 3 teammates from Chelyabinsk who I've only just met.
